Didn't have time to do this test in the weekend. Did a part in a couple hours. I will finish Monday morning.

## Getting Started

First install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
